	abstract = {The importance of robust proton treatment planning to mitigate the impact of uncertainty is well understood. However, its computational cost grows with the number of uncertainty scenarios, prolonging the treatment planning 	
				process. We developed a fast and scalable distributed optimization platform that parallelizes the robust proton treatment plan computation over the uncertainty scenarios. We modeled the robust proton treatment planning problem as a weighted least-squares problem. To solve it, we employed an optimization technique called the alternating direction method of multipliers with Barzilai–Borwein step size (ADMM-BB). We reformulated the problem in such a way as to split the main problem into smaller subproblems, one for each proton therapy uncertainty scenario. The subproblems can be solved in parallel, allowing the computational load to be distributed across multiple processors (e.g., CPU threads/cores). We evaluated ADMM-BB on four head-and-neck proton therapy patients, each with 13 scenarios accounting for 3 mm setup and 3.5% range uncertainties. We then compared the performance of ADMM-BB with projected gradient descent (PGD) applied to the same problem. For each patient, ADMM-BB generated a robust proton treatment plan that satisfied all clinical criteria with comparable or better dosimetric quality than the plan generated by PGD. However, ADMM-BB’s total runtime averaged about 6 to 7 times faster. This speedup increased with the number of scenarios. ADMM-BB is a powerful distributed optimization method that leverages parallel processing platforms, such as multicore CPUs, GPUs, and cloud servers, to accelerate the computationally intensive work of robust proton treatment planning. This results in (1) a shorter treatment planning process and (2) the ability to consider more uncertainty scenarios, which improves plan quality.}

	abstract = {We present an optimization-based approach to radiation treatment planning over time. Our approach formulates treatment planning as an optimal control problem with nonlinear patient health dynamics derived from the standard 
				linear-quadratic cell survival model. As the formulation is nonconvex, we propose a method for obtaining an approximate solution by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems. This method is fast, efficient, and robust to model error, adapting readily to changes in the patient's health between treatment sessions. Moreover, we show that it can be combined with the operator splitting method ADMM to produce an algorithm that is highly scalable and can handle large clinical cases. We introduce an open-source Python implementation of our algorithm, AdaRad, and demonstrate its performance on several examples.}

				statistical learning, computational imaging, telecommunications, and optimal control. To solve it, we propose an Anderson accelerated Douglas--Rachford splitting (A2DR) algorithm, which we show either globally converges or provides a certificate of infeasibility/unboundedness under very mild conditions. Applied to a block separable objective, A2DR partially decouples so that its steps may be carried out in parallel, yielding an algorithm that is fast and scalable to multiple processors. We describe an open-source implementation and demonstrate its performance on a wide range of examples.}

				syntax rather than the restrictive form required by most solvers. The user specifies an objective and set of constraints by combining constants, variables, and parameters using a library of functions with known mathematical properties. CVXR then applies signed disciplined convex programming (DCP) to verify the problem’s convexity. Once verified, the problem is converted into standard conic form using graph implementations and passed to a cone solver such as ECOS or SCS. We demonstrate CVXR’s modeling framework with several applications.}

				constraints as part of a convex formulation. Since dose-volume constraints are non-convex, we replace them with a convex restriction. This restriction is, by definition, conservative; to mitigate its impact on the clinical objectives, we develop a two-pass planning algorithm that allows each dose-volume constraint to be met exactly on a second pass by the solver if its corresponding restriction is feasible on the first pass. In another variant, we add slack variables to each dose constraint to prevent the problem from becoming infeasible when the user specifies an incompatible set of constraints or when the constraints are made infeasible by our restriction. Finally, we introduce ConRad, a Python-embedded open-source software package for convex radiation treatment planning. ConRad implements the methods described above and allows users to construct and plan cases through a simple interface.}

				calculations of the plasmonic enhancement using finite element methods confirms the role that the substrate plays in increasing the intensity and spatial extent of the SERS enhancement. It is shown that because of the cylindrical shape of the nanowires, significant SERS hot spots form not only between crossed nanowires but also at the point of contact between the nanowires and the substrate on which they are placed. This result also applies to any structure whose geometry results in a point or line contact with an underlying substrate.}

				dispersive spectroscopy, and magnetometry. The addition of Cu, Ga, Mn, and Al completely eliminated the large hysteresis losses present in the undoped Gd5Ge2Si2 alloy between 270 and 330 K, broadened the magnetic entropy change ΔSm peak, and shifted its peak value from 275 to 305 K similar to that observed earlier for Gd5Ge1.9Si2Fe0.1. The addition of Bi or Sn had a negligible effect on either the alloy hysteresis losses or the characteristics of the ΔSm vs T peak. The microstructure of the alloy doped with Cu, Co, Ga, Mn, or Al consisted of a majority phase (depleted of silicon) and a minor intergranular phase (rich in silicon and of the corresponding metal additive). For Bi or Sn doping, the microstructure consisted of only the Gd5Ge2Si2 phase. Low temperature x-ray diffraction data on an Fe-doped sample showed the same spectra at 245 and 300 K, consistent with the majority phase possessing an orthorhombic structure. Refrigeration capacity calculations show that Gd5Ge1.9Si2X0.1 (X=Fe,Cu,Co,Ga,Mn, or Al) alloys are superior magnetic refrigerants compared to the undoped Gd5Ge2Si2 alloy.}

				from an orthorhombic to a monoclinic structure at the Curie temperature (TC ¼ 276 K). On the other hand, the matrix of Gd5(Ge1:8Fe0:2)Si2 with the orthorhombic structure in the ferromagnetic state shows two-phases co-existence of the orthorhombic and the monoclinic structures above TC ¼ 303 K, indicating that a small amount of the matrix participates in the transformation. For both samples, the monoclinic structure is suppressed but the orthorhombic structure is enhanced just above TC by applying a magnetic field, which closely relates to the magnetization process.}
