I am an Assistant Attending faculty member in the Department of Medical Physics, Computer Services division of [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org). My research addresses problems in cancer radiation therapy, particularly radiation treatment planning and radiobiological modeling, using the tools of optimization. I design, develop, and implement efficient algorithms for large-scale optimization and machine learning with applications to IMRT, IMPT, VMAT, and other treatment modalities. I work closely with the doctors at MSK to write software that can be deployed in the clinic. Separate from my cancer research, I also develop solvers for convex optimization -- see my work on [CVXR](https://cvxr.rbind.io). 

I completed a M.S. in Statistics and a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Stephen P. Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd) and [Lei Xing](https://med.stanford.edu/xinglab.html). Afterward, I joined MSK as a postdoctoral research scholar in the lab of [Joseph O. Deasy](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/joseph-deasy) and [Masoud Zarepisheh](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/masoud-zarepisheh). Prior to my academic career, I worked as a machine learning scientist at the start-up [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai), which develops software and algorithms for distributed AI applications.
