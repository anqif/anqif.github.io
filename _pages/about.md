I am an Assistant Attending faculty member in the Department of Medical Physics at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org) (MSK). My research addresses problems in cancer radiation therapy, particularly radiation treatment planning and radiobiological modeling, using the tools of optimization. I design, develop, and implement efficient algorithms for large-scale optimization and machine learning with applications to IMRT, IMPT, VMAT, and other treatment modalities. I work closely with the doctors at MSK to write applications that can be deployed in the clinic. Separate from my cancer research, I also develop software for convex optimization -- see my work on [CVXR](https://cvxr.rbind.io).

I completed a M.S. in Statistics and a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Stephen P. Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd) and [Lei Xing](https://med.stanford.edu/xinglab.html). Afterward, I joined MSK as a postdoctoral research scholar in the lab of [Joseph O. Deasy](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/joseph-deasy) and [Masoud Zarepisheh](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/masoud-zarepisheh), where I conducted research on robust proton therapy. Prior to my academic career, I worked as a machine learning scientist at the start-up [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai) developing software and algorithms for distributed AI applications.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
