== About Me
I completed a M.S. in Statistics and a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University with Profs. Stephen P. Boyd and Lei Xing. I then joined Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) as a postdoctoral research scholar, advised by Drs. Joseph O. Deasy and Masoud Zarepisheh. Currently, I am an Assistant Attending faculty member at MSKCC in the Department of Medical Physics, Computer Services division. Prior to my academic career, I worked as a machine learning scientist at [http://www.h2o.ai/ H2O.ai], developing algorithms and software for large-scale machine learning applications.
